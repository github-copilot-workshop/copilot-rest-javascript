# Learning GitHub Copilot with Express.js Project

This project is an Express.js application designed to demonstrate and facilitate the learning of GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. Through the implementation of new API routes and unit tests, this project serves as a practical guide to understanding how to effectively use GitHub Copilot in your development workflow.

## Project Overview

The project is structured around a simple Express.js application that includes several routes, views, and a stylesheet. It's set up to run on a Node.js server and uses EJS for templating. The main focus of this project is to add new functionality to the application by leveraging GitHub Copilot's capabilities.


## Getting Started

Before diving into the code, make sure to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
To start the application, run:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the server on http://localhost:3000, where you can access the implemented routes.

## Learning GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is integrated into this project as a tool to accelerate the development process and to provide an opportunity for learning through doing. The documentation in docs/001-implement-new-route.md outlines specific tasks to be completed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, including the addition of new API routes and the completion of unit tests.

### Implementing New Routes
The document guides you through the process of using GitHub Copilot to add a new "Hello World" route to the application. It emphasizes the importance of precise prompts to effectively communicate your intentions to GitHub Copilot.

### Completing Unit Tests
Another key learning aspect is using GitHub Copilot to address failing unit tests. The document provides instructions on how to use GitHub Copilot to start and stop the application before and after running tests, ensuring a smooth testing process.

### Conclusion
This project not only serves as a practical introduction to developing with Express.js but also as a hands-on guide to mastering GitHub Copilot. By following the steps outlined in the documentation, you'll gain valuable insights into how GitHub Copilot can enhance your coding experience and productivity.
